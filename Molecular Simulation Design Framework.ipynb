    "**<u>Mo</u>**lecular **<u>S</u>**imulation **<u>De</u>**sign **<u>F</u>**ramework, or MoSDeF, is a robust Python-based, open-source software framework designed to faciliate the initialization, atom-typing, and screeening of soft matter system using molecular dynamics simulation. The project was developed initially at Vanderbilt University, in collaboration with software engineer from the Institute for Software Integrated System (ISIS). The project later expanded into a multi-university collaboration with Vanderbilt University being the lead institute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MoSDeF software suite comprises several libraries, namely `mbuild`, `foyer`, and `gmso`, each targets a different component of system initialization. Specifically, `mbuild` library can be used to systematically construct any molecular systems, either atomistic or coarse-grained, while `foyer` can be used to atom-type (assign type and parameters) to all particles, bonds, angles, and dihedrals in the created system. The `gmso` library, which is still under development, will be the main data structure that can be used to store all the information of the system, including the details of the system (particles and their positions) and parameters of all the atom types, bond types, angle types, and dihedral types. \n",
    "\n",
    "By creating tools that allow user to easily put together complicated system and automating \"trivial\" but rather tedius steps (such as writing out to simulation engine specific molecular files), MoSDeF allows user to focus on system design, be able to build more (quantity-wise) and complicated systems. This does not increase the capability of molecular research, especially screening studies, where research iterate over a wide variable space (so many of unqiue systems)."

    "`mBuild`, a Python library within the MoSDeF software suite, is a general purpose tool for constructing molecular system in a scriptable manner. Unlike other existing tools in the community, which only focus on specific type of molecular system (bilayer, monlayer), and employ GUIs, which may hamper reproducibility and could not be used for fully automated workflows, `mbuild` allows user to hiearachically construct complex system from smaller, interchangable pieces that can be connected through the use of generative, or procedural, modeling. \n",

    "The `Compound` class is the core structure of `mbuild`. `mbuild.Compound` is a general purpose container that can be used to describe anything within a molecular system, either a particle, a coarse-grained beads, a collection atoms, a collection of `Compound`, or operations (e.g. a `Compound` that includes a routien to perform polymerization). The `Compounds` can be connected via different mechanism, either generatively by directly adding a `Bond` between the two interested `Compound`, or procedurally, by adding a `Port` to the two `Compound` that needed to be joined. The lalter method employs more sophistacated vector transformation methods to maintain appropriate orientation and distance of the final bond.    \n",

    "\n",
    "The Foyer library is a tool to apply force fields information to molecular system (i.e. atomtyping). Foyer provides a standardized approach to defining chemical context (atomtyping rules), along with associated force field parameters. The atomtyping rules are encoded, not in the source code, but in an XML file that is an extension of OpenMM forcefield file format. The `foyer` software itself is used to interpretand apply the rules and thus the software is not limited to use with only a single force field type. This distinguish `foyer` from other tools currently available aiding the atomtyping process, which usually only support a specific forcefiled. Automating the process of applying forcefield to molecular system do not only improve the efficiency of the process, but also improve the accuracy/reproducibility comparing to \n",

The SMARTS strings used to define atomtypes are read into a `SMARTSGraph` class which inherits from NetworkX's core data structure. Using the `find_matches` method, a `SMARTSGraph` instance can search for subgraph isomorphisms of itself within a provided chemical topology and will yield all atoms that match the first token in the original SMARTS string.\n",
