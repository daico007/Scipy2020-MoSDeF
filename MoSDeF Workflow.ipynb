    "**<u>Mo</u>**lecular **<u>S</u>**imulation **<u>De</u>**sign **<u>F</u>**ramework, or MoSDeF, is a robust Python-based, open-source software framework designed to faciliate the initialization, atom-typing, and screening of soft matter systems for molecular simulation. The project was initially developed at Vanderbilt University, in collaboration with software engineers from the Vanderbilt Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS). The project has now expanded into a multi-university collaboration with Vanderbilt University as the lead institution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoSDeF software suite comprises three main libraries: `mbuild`, `foyer`, and `GMSO`.  Each library targets a different step of system initialization. Specifically, the `mbuild` library can be used to systematically construct any molecular system, including atomistic and coarse-grained molecules. `Foyer` can be used to assign interaction parameters to all particles, bonds, angles, and dihedrals in the created system. Finally, the `GMSO` library, currently under development, will serve as the main data structure to store all the information of the system, including the details of the system (particles and their positions) along with interaction types and parameters of that system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoSDeF tools allow users to build complicated systems in a manner that is scriptable and automatable.   This enables molecular simulation studies to be more transparent and reproducible, as these scripts can be easily shared on software hosting services, such as GitHub.  Automation also allows for rapid system initialization for large-scale screening studies, a rapidly growing subset of the molecular simulation field."

    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how MoSDeF can be used in a molecular simulation workflow. Along the way we will highlight important features of each package. In context of a short demonstration, we will run a simple simulation (equilibrium simulation of a box of small molecules). At the end of the notebook, examples of more complicated workflows/tutorials, which were inspired by previously published work, are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration purposes, we will be using [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to show off various functionality of MoSDeF.  Note that typical system initialization workflows using MoSDeF are entirely written in Python and do not involve the use of Widgets. Once any of the widgets are activated, it will also print the script of what is happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducible molecular simulations, using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are discouraged, as these tools usually obfuscate the specific settings and parameters needed to replicate the work by an external user. Although, in demonstrations and presentations, GUIs can be quite valuable as a visual aid."
